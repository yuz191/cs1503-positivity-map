    "The idea of summarizing and visualizing events and emotions of the entire world received a lot of attention in the Machine Learning community. As an example see how the [GDELT project](https://www.gdeltproject.org/) tried to convert world media and news into visualizations of the events and emotions: [LINK](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4366/3654) \n",

    "\n",
    "For each new document with words $Word_1 … Word_n$ and each category $c$ compute the probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(Category = c | Word1 = true, …, Wordn = true) =\\alpha*P(Category = c) \\prod_{i=1}^n P(Wordi = true | Category = c)$\n",

    "\n",
    "Note, that we don't calculate any real probabilities here. Instead, we are estimating which class is more likely, given the evidence (words). This is another reason why Naïve Bayes is so robust: It is not so much interested in the real probabilities, but only determines which class is more likely. "

    "## Dataset\n",
    "Our training dataset was obtained from the Niek Sanders corpus, who has done an awesome job of **manually** labeling more than 5,000 tweets with 4 categories: Positive, Negative, Neutral, and Irrelevant. In general, you could use his script, [install.py](https://github.com/zfz/twitter_corpus.git), to fetch the corresponding Twitter text by tweet id. Because the script is playing nicely with Twitter's servers, it might take quite some time to download the data, so the dataset [full-corpus.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n3XFcUp8yoLf4BOj0rxEpTw1VCwyK1s-/view?usp=sharing) has been already pre-created for you by your hard-working instructor:). \n",
    "\n",
    "We also preprocessed the dataset, leaving only 2 relevant columns: the text of a twit, and the sentiment class. The preprocessed dataset is in file [labeled_corpus.tsv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NXvKTuTO6oNjonKkDm2DGdN5fqj-2RE7/view?usp=drive_link), and the tweet text is separated from the class label using tab (‘\\t’). That is why the file extension is tsv - which means tab-separated values (similar to csv - comma-separated values). This is our training dataset, used to estimate the probabilities of words given a category. Download the dataset [labeled_corpus.tsv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NXvKTuTO6oNjonKkDm2DGdN5fqj-2RE7/view?usp=drive_link), and place it in the same directory where your notebook is.\n",
